Solution

1 - If the pack is less than the minimum element in array return
the firts element of the array;

2 - If the pack is more than the minimum element in array, so we
need to divide the pack with the maximum element less the pack;

3 - The algorithm doing the step 2 until the waste of the divide
is less than 0;

4 - Afther step 3, the resuld should be reduce que result just
with element inside the array.
